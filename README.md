# ft_printf
A naive implementation of the <stdio.h> printf() function as part of the 42 curriculum.

### Compiling the ft_printf static library
To use this ft_printf function, either download the zip or `git clone` the repository and run `make` in the root of the project directory. This will generate a static library that you can include in your program.

### Compiling with ft_printf static library
Once you've run `make` and made `libftprintf.a` you can use the function with your programs by adding `#include "ft_printf.h"` in your .h file or directly in your project files.

When compiling make sure to link the `libftprintf.a` library. An example:

`gcc -I includes -o my_program my_file.c my_other_file.c -L. -lftprintf`

Then just run your program!
